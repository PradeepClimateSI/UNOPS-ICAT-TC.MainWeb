## Portfolio
1. Componant, All letters in the name are lowercase and a hyphen is used to separate words in a name.(Kebab case (kebab-case))
2. Class names All first letters of every word should be capitalized, except for the first word.

3. Write as few lines as possible in method.
4. Use appropriate naming conventions.
5. Segment blocks of code in the same section into paragraphs.
6. Don’t use lengthy functions. Ideally, a single function should carry out a single task.
7. Use the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle. Automate repetitive tasks whenever necessary. The same piece of code should not be repeated in the script.
8. Avoid Deep Nesting. Too many nesting levels make code harder to read and follow.
9. Capitalize SQL special words and function names to distinguish them from table and column names.
10. Avoid long lines. It is easier for humans to read blocks of lines that are horizontally short and vertically long.
11. If a method has a long list of parameters (subjective), consider passing parameter objects that encapsulate common parameters.
12. Avoid using magic number.
13. Avoid Hard-Coded Numerical Values.
14. Code Refactoring
15. Exception handling
16. Don’t use a single identifier for multiple purposes
